# Enhanced Control Checker GBA
a button test rom for the Game Boy Advance. Heavily inspired by Orangeglo's Better Button Test for the GB (which is superior to this) I just needed a rom to test the L and R buttons.

Made with devKitPro, you can build it if you want but I am not going to show you how

### Thanks to
Orangeglo for the idea and for their Better Button Test GB and for all their cool stuff pls check out OrangeFM!
