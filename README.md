# Enhanced Control Checker GBA

![enhancedcontrolchecker-0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5741c859-222b-43eb-97e3-adf6d85a34dd)

a button test rom for the Game Boy Advance. Heavily inspired by Orangeglo's Better Button Test for the GB (which is superior to this) I just needed a rom to test the L and R buttons.

- counts the amount of times a button is pressed
- plays a not so plesent tone 

Made with devKitPro, you can build it if you want but I am not going to show you how

### Thanks to
